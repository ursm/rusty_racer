    # loops. memory_limit caps the V8 heap in bytes: a script that exceeds the
    # ceiling is terminated and raises V8OutOfMemoryError rather than aborting
    # the process, and the isolate stays usable afterward. 0 (the default) does
    # NOT disable this — it leaves V8's own platform-derived default ceiling
    # (typically ~2 GB on 64-bit) in place, so a runaway is still catchable
    # instead of a fatal abort; pass a smaller value for a tighter bound. It is
    # a soft limit — V8 enforces it at GC granularity, so usage may briefly
    # overshoot, and an explicit limit must comfortably exceed the isolate's
    # baseline (and any snapshot's baked-in heap), since it is only armed once
    # the isolate has booted. Caveat: if the process's available memory (e.g. a
    # container cgroup limit) is below the active ceiling, the OS may kill the
    # process before V8's callback fires — set an explicit memory_limit under
    # that bound to keep the error catchable.
