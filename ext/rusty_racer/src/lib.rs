// The Ruby half. A Magnus extension running V8 IN-THREAD: each Isolate runs on
// the Ruby thread that created it (Core::run opens a scope and calls
// service_request inline, releasing the GVL around the JS), with no dedicated V8
// thread and no request channel — the thread-hop cost that model paid per op is
// gone (see the inthread-perf migration). An op's reply is service_request's
// return value, not a channel message.
//
// THREAD-BINDING is the load-bearing constraint. rusty_v8 v150 makes
// OwnedIsolate !Send and binds no v8::Locker, and V8's enter/exit + HandleScope
// are native-thread-bound — yet Magnus wrappers must be Send (Ruby objects
// migrate threads) and Ruby 4.0's M:N scheduler moves a Ruby thread across
// native threads. The binding reconciles these:
//   - The isolate is bound to its owner RUBY thread (rb_thread_current; a native
//     ThreadId is unstable under M:N). Every op asserts owner == current and
//     raises otherwise — a foreign-thread use can't concurrently touch a
//     !Locker isolate.
//   - ALL V8 access for one op (enter -> scope -> JS -> scope-drop -> exit) runs
//     inside ONE without_gvl, hence on one native thread with no GVL boundary
//     mid-op (the OwnedIsolate is entered per top-level op and exited between
//     ops, so several isolates coexist on one thread in any dispose order).
//   - The OwnedIsolate lives boxed in a global registry (ISOLATES); Core keeps a
//     stable raw ptr into it. !Send is contained behind the owner-thread assert.
//
// Host callbacks and module resolvers run INLINE: with_gvl reacquires the GVL to
// run the Ruby proc, then returns into JS; a nested op the proc issues just
// recurses into Core::run (depth > 0, callback_scope!) — re-entrancy is the Rust
// call stack, not a channel round-trip. A Ruby exception is a magnus Err value
// (no longjmp through V8 frames), re-thrown JS-side; an instantiate resolver's
// exception is re-raised with its original class. The watchdog (a per-isolate
// thread firing TerminateExecution via the Send IsolateHandle) stays; the
// OUTERMOST op cancels a stale terminate so it can't poison the next op, while a
// nested op's cancel never erases a termination aimed at the suspended outer JS.
//
// Attached procs and the dynamic-import resolver are GC-rooted via
// rb_gc_register_address (see RootedProc): marked, so the extension may hold the
// only reference, and pinned, so GC.compact cannot move them behind the
// extension's back.
